# Predict-Restaurant-Inspections
-- Hosted by Drivendata (http://www.drivendata.org/)

###Goal
Use data from social media(Yelp reviews) to narrow the search for health code violations in Boston. 

###The Challenge
Figure out the words, phrases, ratings, and patterns that predict violations, to help public health inspectors do their job better.

###My approach
Taking help from the benchmark code and tweaking the parameters.
